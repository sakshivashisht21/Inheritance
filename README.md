# Inheritance
Inheritance: In object-oriented programming, the derived/child class can inherit many properties from the base/parent class. Here, we mean that the derived/child class can use an existing method or behaviour, which the base/parent class has.
Different types of inheritances - single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multi level inheritance, hierarchical inheritance and hybrid inheritance.
